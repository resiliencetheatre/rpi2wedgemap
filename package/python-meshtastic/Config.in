	A Python client for use with Meshtastic devices. This small 
	library (and example application) provides an easy API for 
	sending and receiving messages over mesh radios. It also 
	provides access to any of the operations/data available 
	in the device user interface or the Android application. 
	Events are delivered using a publish-subscribe model, and 
	you can subscribe to only the message types you are 
	interested in.
